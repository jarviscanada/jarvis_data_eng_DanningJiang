summary: "I graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from Lakehead University. 
I mainly focused on machine learning and deep learning during my graduate study. 
Currently, I am working at the Jarvis Consulting Group and concentrating on software development. 
I also had some hands-on experience in software development before, one of which is web development using the latest techniques like javascript, React, GraphQL, and Node.js, with the Neo4j database. 
Also, I worked as an Android developer  and used Kotlin as language. For both those developments, I did the UI design for them as well, which I'm always interested in. 
After joining Jarvis, I consolidated my knowledge of Java,Springboot, Linux, SQL, Bash, Git, and Docker techniques. 
It is worth mentioning that I had designed and implemented a library seat selecting and booking system which was developed in C#, using B/S architecture. 
I am highly detail-oriented and logical, also a fast learner, and have a strong motivation to work on cutting-edge technologies with a good sense of coding, I pursue high-quality and easy-to-understand code. I'm very engaging and full of exuding positive energy too."

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring Agent"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Developed the monitoring agent program aims to record the hardware specifications of each host and monitor host resource usage (e.g. CPU/Memory) in real-time. 
    The agent was installed on each server to collect both hardware specification data and resource usage data, and then persisted the collected data into an RDBMS database through a psql instance(container). 
    Used cron job to collect data automatically and detect the data usage. Technologies being used include Bash, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL."
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: Built a Java Twitter command line CRUD application that uses Twitter's REST APIs to provide services to the end-user, such as being able post, show, or delete Tweets. The application follows the MVC architecture and comprises multiple layers to facilitate development and testing. Spring Boot was used to manage all of the dependencies. JUnit and Mockito were used to test the application, and Maven was used to package it. Deployment was done using Docker."
      - "JDBC App: Implemented a JDBC app that connects Java to a PostgreSQL database. It allows performing CRUD operations on retail database by mapping the Java objects to the relational database tables through the JDBC interface. It was built using the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern and tested on generated SQL sales data, made in Java with the Maven."
      - "Grep App: Developed a java tool which can search through all files recursively under a specified directory with given text pattern, similar to the GREP command in Linux. The app was written in Java 8 and utilizes its features such as Lambdas and Streams for efficient data processing. It was created using the Maven and packaged using Docker and available on DockerHub."
  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: "Performed data analytics that helps the marketing team of a retailer by analyzing and visualizing their customer shopping behaviour data.
    The data was stored in a PostgreSQL database which was provisioned using a docker container, and it was connected to the Jupyter Notebook to perform analyses. 
    Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib libraries are used to wrangle the dataset as well as display the results. OLAP method was used to analyze massive volumes of data rapidly."
