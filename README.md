**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DanningJiang/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed the monitoring agent program aims to record the hardware specifications of each host and monitor host resource usages (e.g. CPU/Memory) in real-time. The agent will be installed on each server to collect both hardware specification data and resource usage data, and then persist the collected data into an RDBMS database through a psql instance(container).Used crotab job to execute the script every minute. The program can be installed on each server and collect data automatically and detect the data usage. Technologies being used include Bash, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL.

The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is provisioned using a docker container, and it is connected to the Jupyter Notebook to perform analyses. Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib libraries are used to wrangle the dataset as well as display the results. It uses OLAP to analyze massive volumes of data rapidly.
