summary: "I recently graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from Lakehead University. 
I mainly focused on Machine Learning and Deep Learning during my graduate study. 
Currently, I joined the Jarvis Consulting Group and I am concentrating on Software Development. 
I have some internship hands-on experience in software development, one of which is web development, using the latest techniques like javascript, React, Apollo, Node.js, with the Neo4j database. 
And another one is about android app development, I developed some basic fragments using Kotlin. 
And for both those developments, I also did the UI design for them, which I'm always interested in. 
After joining Jarvis, I consolidated my knowledge of Java, Linux, SQL, Bash, Git, etc, and also grasped the Docker techniques. 
It is worth mentioning that I have designed and implemented a library seat selecting and booking system which was developed in C#, using B/S architecture. 
I am highly detail-oriented and logical. I am a fast learner and have a strong motivation to work on cutting-edge technologies and have a good sense of coding, I pursue high-quality and easy-to-understand codes. 
I also have a very engaging personality and exude positive energy."

  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring Agent"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Developed the monitoring agent program aims to record the hardware specifications of each host and monitor host resource usages (e.g. CPU/Memory) in real-time. 
    The agent was installed on each server to collect both hardware specification data and resource usage data, and then persisted the collected data into an RDBMS database through a psql instance(container). 
    Used crontab job to execute the script to collect data automatically and detect the data usage. Technologies being used include Bash, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL."
  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "/python_data_analytics"
    description: "Performed data analytics that helps the marketing team of a retailer by analyzing and visualizing their customer shopping behaviour data.
    The data was stored in a PostgreSQL database which was provisioned using a docker container, and it was connected to the Jupyter Notebook to perform analyses. 
    Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib libraries are used to wrangle the dataset as well as display the results. OLAP method was used to analyze massive volumes of data rapidly."
