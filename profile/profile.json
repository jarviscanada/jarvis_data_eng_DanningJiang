Combined the system with an access control system and realized the function of login verification, seat selection, reservation, cancellation, etc. Realized adding and deleting seats dynamically on the actual seat layout. The whole system was developed in C#, SQL Server, and used the B/S architecture through Visual Studio.",

The agent was installed on each server to collect both hardware specification data and resource usage data, and then persisted the collected data into an RDBMS database through a psql instance(container). Used crontab job to execute the script to collect data automatically and detect the data usage. Technologies being used include Bash, Docker, Git, PostgreSQL.",

  "summary": "I recently graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from Lakehead University. I mainly focused on Machine Learning and Deep Learning during my graduate study. Currently, I joined the Jarvis Consulting Group and I am concentrating on Software Development. I have some internship hands-on experience in software development, one of which is web development, using the latest techniques like javascript, React, Apollo, Node.js, with the Neo4j database. And another one is about android app development, I developed some basic fragments using Kotlin. And for both those developments, I also did the UI design for them, which I'm always interested in. After joining Jarvis, I consolidated my knowledge of Java, Linux, SQL, Bash, Git, etc, and also grasped the Docker techniques. It is worth mentioning that I have designed and implemented a library seat selecting and booking system which was developed in C#, using B/S architecture. I am highly detail-oriented and logical. I am a fast learner and have a strong motivation to work on cutting-edge technologies and have a good sense of coding, I pursue high-quality and easy-to-understand codes. I also have a very engaging personality and exude positive energy."
