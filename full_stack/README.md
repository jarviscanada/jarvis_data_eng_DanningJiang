# Twitter CRUD Web
This Twitter Web application with full CRUD functionalities and was created using Angular as front-end and Node.js and Express as back-end.
Also connecting PostgreSQL database through Knex.js.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

## Get started
### Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DanningJiang.git
cd full_stack
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
